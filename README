What is RubyFilter?

    This is a framework for filtering mail, possibly modifying it, and
    delivering it to various mailbox formats.

    RubyFilter is available at:

        http://www.lickey.com/rubyfilter/

    RubyFilter depends on RubyMail, available at:

        http://www.lickey.com/rubymail/

Why?

    The world needs alternatives to procmail.  I wanted one that
    allowed me to write a mail filter in a fully capable scripting
    language.

Status

    This package is currently very raw.  All API is subject to change.
    I very much appreciate suggestions and comments.

    However, I do use this for all of my own mail filtering.

Documentation

    See the doc/ subdirectory for HTML documentation.

Tests?

    This package has a complete unit test suite (requires RubyUnit to
    run).
