* Changes in RubyFilter 0.9 (released 2002-01-16)

** New DeliveryAgent#filter method that can be used to filter a message
   through an external command, possibly changing the message.

** DeliveryAgent::DeliveryPipeFailure renamed to
   DeliveryAgent::DeliveryCommandFailure since it is now raised by
   DeliveryAgent#pipe as well as DeliveryAgent#filter.

** DeliveryAgent#defer and DeliveryAgent#reject now have a default
   argument for the message string.

** Other changes to bring up to date with current RubyMail and Ruby
   1.8.0.

* Changes in RubyFilter 0.8 (released 2002-03-18)

** Created from RubyMail 0.7

** All Mail::* constants moved into the RFilter:: module.

** Mail::Deliver.deliver_mbox returns the name of the file delivered
   to.

** rdeliver.rb now prints DeliveryDever and DeliveryReject messages to
   stdout in the hopes that the MTA will include them in the bounce
   message.

** Renamed Mail::LDA to RFilter::DeliveryAgent.

** RFilter::Deliver.deliver_maildir -- bring in line with the
   Maildir delivery spec (i.e. stat the tmp file before trying to open
   it instead of relying on O_EXCL).
