* Changes in RubyFilter 0.8 (released 2002-03-18)

** Created from RubyMail 0.7

** All Mail::* constants moved into the RubyFilter:: module.

** Mail::Deliver.deliver_mbox returns the name of the file delivered
   to.

** rdeliver.rb now prints DeliveryDever and DeliveryReject messages to
   stdout in the hopes that the MTA will include them in the bounce
   message.

** Renamed Mail::LDA to RubyFilter::DeliveryAgent.

** RubyFilter::Deliver.deliver_maildir -- bring in line with the
   Maildir delivery spec (i.e. stat the tmp file before trying to open
   it instead of relying on O_EXCL).
